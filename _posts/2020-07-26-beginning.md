Starting my Chinese studies.

<!--more-->

Bought this domain almost exactly a year ago with the intention of merely saving the domain name, should I need it in the future.
At the time, I was naively under the impression that I could quickly get to a basic understanding of Japanese, so I could play Persona 5 Royal by the time it released. Well, the release date rolled around and my understanding of the language was still in its infancy. Yet, here we are -- well past the American release of P5R, and my Japanese skill is still levels below that of a kindergartener's. Besides P5R, I had initially taken up my study of the language because I already consumed Japanese through the medium of anime pretty regularly, and figured I may as well put in the time to learn the language, so it's not a complete waste of my time watching these cartoons ... BUT I digress, the point is, here I am now. Starting anew. Not with Japanese, but instead, the language I promised my 11 year old self to one day learn, as I buried my head into foreign dictionaries in the school library day after day. That, of course, is **Mandarin** ! Hopefully I can make myself proud.
